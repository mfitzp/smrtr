<div class="question dropcap">QWhat is SQ?</div>
<p class="answer">SQ or "smrtr Quotient" is the measure of your relative intelligence on the smrtr system.
Just like an SQ it is calculated from your performance on the questions your attempt, and relative to other people.</p>
<p class="answer">As with an IQ, the average SQ is <em>always</em> 100, and you can score anywhere between 0 and 200. As other people's SQ scores
go up, yours will go down. So you need to keep working to stay on top!</p>
